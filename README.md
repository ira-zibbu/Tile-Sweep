# Tile-Sweep
Tile Sweep is a basic game created using the MATLAB App Designer for [Synaptic Hacks 2021](https://www.simplyneuroscience.org/synaptichacks2021), hosted by [Simply Neuroscience](https://www.simplyneuroscience.org). Our project centered on the production of serious games to replace or aid existing quantitative assessments of cognitive impairment.
To start playing, the user must press the 'START' button. Some of the titles in the 3x3 grid will light up and disappear. Once they disappear, the user must click on titles that had lit up, as fast as possible and then press 'END' once done. This completes a single round. The entire game consists of 6 such rounds. Once all 6 rounds are completed, press 'PRINT SCORE'. This prints the scores of all 6 rounds into one excel file in the working directory.
At its core, the game tests for visual memory, working memory and processing speed. The score alloted is an efficieny score obtained by dividing the accuracy by the total time taken.
This rudimentary game demonstrates a proof of concept and can be scaled up to increasing or decreasing difficulties.
